install docker(see their website)
make sure you do 'docker upgrade' or whatever it is
Once docker is started:

docker pull edlafem1/centos66:workingv2
docker run -ti -p 49156:5000 --name xeno -v <path to wherever you have stuff on your computer>:/host_data edlafem1/centos66:workingv2 /bin/bash

To stop the container, just type 'exit'
To restart: docker -i xeno

And thats it for docker. Python and all that should be installed and everything else.
To start/stop the MariaDB service, I have two scripts in the root directory of the image that you can just use(self explanatory)
Once you have run the website(use python backbone.py when you are in the xeno/backend directory), you can go into your web browser to:
http://192.168.59.103:49156
and it should work
